        		<h1>Using a TEG generator to convert Excess Heat into Electricity</h1>
				<h3> Question: </h3>
        			<p> I'm building a rocket mass heater and want to power a light and maybe my computer:<br>
				a) Do I need a charger converter? <br>
				b) What specifications should I look out for in the TEG I get: Max Temp, Max Voltage output, etc? </p>
			<h3> Answer: </h3>
				<p > a) The output of different TEG's vary widely, so you will definitely need some type of voltage regulator to
				ensure your final output is at the right voltage. To get an idea, I'd look into other peoples systems, such as 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaT2hqHgLdY">DIY Perks'setup</a>.
				He uses this nifty thing like this to charge a phone (or other 5V usb device)

				If you want to charge your computer, things get a bit tricker for 2 reasons:<br>
					- You'll need to convert to AC current, since the TEG outputs DC and your computer power supply wants AC.
					So you'd need an inverter (AC-DC).<br>
					- You need your TEG system to output more power, through a much higher voltage (~20V) and current
					(~3A) since most computers require at least that.<br><br>
				b) The two specs I would be most concerned with are Max Temp and Max Power.<br> 
				I would think the max temp is fairly strict, so if the hot side stays above 300C for long and that was the limit it might be
				toast. It seems that the way to prevent this is by making sure there is a way to dissipate the heat once it is moved to the cold
				side (water, the ground, etc) and not put it too close to the heat source, maybe have something move the heat to it such as a copper
				tube. <br>
				You also want to make sure you're using powerful enough TEGs and/or enough of them to actually get the power you would need, so output
				power is critical.<br>
						
				</p> 
				<p> If I were making this cool system, I would probably start small. Get a couple Peltier Plates, a cheap voltage regulator (?)
				and some type of heatsink.</p>
